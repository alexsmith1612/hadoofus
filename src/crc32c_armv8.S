/*
 * Modified from original FreeBSD source:
 *   - Remove FreeBSD-specific code and includes
 *   - Pull in the #defines from FreeBSD's arm64 asm.h
 *   - Add pre- and post-conditioning (bit inversion) to the crc
 *   - Wrap code in preprocessor architecture condition
 *   - Conditionally don't use the .arch directive on clang versions < 4.0
 *   - Update extern function to be within Hadoofus's namespace
 *   - 2024-03-18: Use .arch_extension rather than .arch directive (backported
 *     from FreeBSD commit 0ec3e991112d85a790ca3bbb4175652f37f4bd15)
