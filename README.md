#### JRE-free multi-version HDFS client library

The `hadoofus` project is an HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) client
library. It is implemented in C and supports RPC pipelining and out-of-order
execution. It does not require Java.

It provides a C API for directly calling Namenode RPCs and performing Datanode
block read and write operations, as well as a `libhdfs`-compatible interface
in a seperate library (`libhdfs_hadoofus.so`).

It also includes a Python wrapper module, implemented in Cython. (Cython
compiles to a C Python module.) For more information on that, see
`/wrappers/README.md`.

Unlike libhdfs, Hadoofus speaks multiple versions of the HDFS protocol. At your
option, you may speak with Hadoop 0.20.203 through 1.x.y (`HDFS_NN_v1` /
`HDFS_DATANODE_AP_1_0`), Hadoop 2.0.x (`HDFS_NN_v2` / `HDFS_DATANODE_AP_2_0`),
or Hadoop 2.2.x and higher (`HDFS_NN_v2_2` / `HDFS_DATANODE_AP_2_0`).

#### Using libhadoofus

```c

#include <hadoofus/highlevel.h>

int64_t res;
const char *err = NULL;
struct hdfs_namenode *h;
struct hdfs_object *exception = NULL;

h = hdfs_namenode_new("host.bar.com", "8020", "hdfs", &err);
if (!h)
        ... ;

res = hdfs_getProtocolVersion(h, HADOOFUS_CLIENT_PROTOCOL_STR, 61L, &exception);
if (exception) {
        // fprintf(, "...%s...", hdfs_exception_get_message(exception));
        hdfs_object_free(exception);
        ... ;
}

if (res != 61)
        ... ;

hdfs_namenode_delete(h);
```

#### Caveats

Some RPCs provided by the Hadoop `ClientProtocol` interface in v2.x of the
protocol are not yet implemented (see Issue #29).

Note: Hadoop has been known to change semantics slightly between different
versions of the software (especially before v2 was released). The v1 protocol
has no spec; we do the best we can.

Some RPCs that exist in HDFSv1 do not exist in HDFSv2+ â€” e.g.
`getProtocolVersion` does not exist in v2.

The Datanode API is somewhat fragile and v2 CRC32C support isn't there yet.

#### HDFS Semantics

HDFS attempts to be a restricted subset of a POSIX filesystem.

Files can only have one writer at a time and do not support random writes. They
can be appended but not overwritten in place.

Generally, the Namenode acts as an RPC server for querying and manipulating
file system metadata. It points clients at Datanode(s) to read/write file data.

[HDFS Architecture Guide][1].

#### ABI Compatibility notes

We aim to preserve ABI compatibility OF THE HIGH-LEVEL C API in future versions
of this library, with some caveats.

1. Users MUST NOT access struct members directly (even though structs are in
   public headers).
2. Users MUST allow for new types of exceptions and do something appropriate
   with surprising types (i.e., abort, treat it as `IOError`, etc).
3. Additional HDFS methods may be added. They will follow the naming scheme
   used throughout this project; users should avoid using such names so that
   future changes will not cause symbol conflicts.
