#### JRE-free multi-version HDFS client library

The `hadoofus` project is an HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) client
library. Like [Snakebite](https://github.com/spotify/snakebite/), it does not
require Java. Unlike Snakebite, hadoofus is implemented in C. It supports RPC
pipelining and out-of-order execution.

It provides a C API for directly calling Namenode RPCs and performing Datanode
block read and write operations.

There is an example `libhdfs`-compatible interface using libhadoofus provided
in a seperate library (`libhdfs_hadoofus.so`).  It should be considered alpha
quality, provided as a proof of concept.

Hadoofus also includes a Python 2 wrapper module, implemented in Cython.
(Cython compiles to a C Python module.) For more information on that, see
`/wrappers/README.md`.

Unlike libhdfs, Hadoofus speaks multiple versions of the HDFS protocol. At your
option, you may speak with Hadoop 0.20.203 through 1.x.y (`HDFS_NN_v1` /
`HDFS_DATANODE_AP_1_0`), Hadoop 2.0.x (`HDFS_NN_v2` / `HDFS_DATANODE_AP_2_0`),
or Hadoop 2.2.x and higher (`HDFS_NN_v2_2` / `HDFS_DATANODE_AP_2_0`).

#### Using libhadoofus

```c

#include <hadoofus/highlevel.h>

int64_t res;
const char *err = NULL;
struct hdfs_namenode *h;
struct hdfs_object *exception = NULL;

h = hdfs_namenode_new("host.bar.com", "8020", "hdfs", &err);
if (!h)
        ... ;

res = hdfs_getProtocolVersion(h, HADOOFUS_CLIENT_PROTOCOL_STR, 61L, &exception);
if (exception) {
        // fprintf(, "...%s...", hdfs_exception_get_message(exception));
        hdfs_object_free(exception);
        ... ;
}

if (res != 61)
        ... ;

hdfs_namenode_delete(h);
```

#### Caveats

Some less common RPCs provided by the Hadoop `ClientProtocol` interface in v2.x
of the protocol are not yet implemented (see Issue #29).

Note: Hadoop has been known to change semantics slightly between different
versions of the software (especially before v2 was released). The v1 protocol
has no spec; we do the best we can.

Some RPCs that exist in HDFSv1 do not exist in HDFSv2+ â€” e.g.
`getProtocolVersion` does not exist in v2.

The Datanode API is somewhat fragile and v2 CRC32C support isn't there yet.

#### HDFS Semantics

HDFS attempts to be a restricted subset of a POSIX filesystem.

Files can only have one writer at a time and do not support random writes. They
can be appended but not overwritten in place.

Generally, the Namenode acts as an RPC server for querying and manipulating
file system metadata. It points clients at Datanode(s) to read/write file data.

For more information, see [wikipedia's article on Hadoop][0] or the
[HDFS Architecture Guide][1].
